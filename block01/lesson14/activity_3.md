## Step 1
You need to make the lightning strike while you are standing on the **gold plates**. First, you need to set the ``||gameplay: weather||`` to rain ``||loops: on start||``. Then placing ``||logic: if||``, ``||blocks: test for||`` and ``||mobs: spawn a lightning bolt||`` inside ``||player: on walk||`` to make the lightning strike at the exact moment. 

### ~ tutorialHint
The gold plates are beneath you at **0, -1, 0** coordinates. 

```ghost
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(GOLD_BLOCK, pos(0, -1, 0))) {
        mobs.spawn(LIGHTNING_BOLT, pos(0, 0, 0))
    }
})
gameplay.setWeather(RAIN)
```
