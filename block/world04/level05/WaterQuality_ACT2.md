## Step 1
Now that you have collected water samples from the surrounding rivers, code a **current** dataset with the water data from each of the locations.

## Step 2 
Start by using a `||Datasets: make dataset||` coding block, set to `||Datasets: current||`. Inside of that, place all of the `||Input: water data||`
from each of the locations. 

```ghost
Input.waterData1_WQ()
Input.waterData2_WQ()
Input.waterData3_WQ()
Datasets.setOfData_WQ(datasetType.historical, function() {})
```
