## Step 1
We are at sea, right next to a coral reef to observe and research the impact of climate change on the corals. 
To do this, we need to place **four** sensors around the reef.
Take the sensors from the chest on the deck of the ship. Then dive into the water and place the sensors on the **gold** blocks on the ocean floor marked 
with a **red banner**. 
Once you have placed all four sensors activity 1 is complete and you can return back to the ship. 
**No coding is required in this activity**.
