# Diamond or dirt?

```python
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
pos(0, 0, 0)
player.say("Finished")
agent.place(LEFT)
agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, DOWN) 
agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
agent.destroy(BACK)
agent.drop_all(FORWARD)
agent.collect_all()
loops.pause(500)
for i in range(10):
    pass
if True: 
    pass
else: 
    pass
elif:
    pass
while True:
    pass
```

## Step 1
Calculate these four sums using code. You need to get the Agent to the gold block, do this by placing a diamond or dirt block depending on the answer of the sums.  If the answer is 1 place a diamond block, if its 0 place a dirt block.
