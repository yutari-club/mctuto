```python
agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
agent.place(RIGHT)
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) 
agent.till(BACK)
for i in range(4):
      pass
if True: 
    pass
else: 
    pass
elif:
    pass
```

## Step 1
**Part 1:** Write three new functions with different sequences, one to make the Agent **move forward**, one to **turn left**, and one to **turn right**. 
Then use these functions in a `||loops:for||` loop to make the Agent pass over every block in the area, row by row, until it reaches the gold block.

## Step 2 
**Part 2:** Add to the code to make the Agent till the grass blocks that it passes over and plant a sapling.
Do this by adding an `||logic:if else||` conditional, that inspects for grass blocks, in the function that moves the Agent forward.
