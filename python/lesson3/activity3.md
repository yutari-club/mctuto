# Activity 3 - Are my calculations off?

```python
player.say("hi")
item +=1
```

## Step 1
Look at tv monitor number 1 and calculate the sum shown by creating a new variable called **cost**. Run the code to show the total cost in the chat.
Press the matching button for that total. 

## Step 2
Look at tv monitor number two. You now need to add a new crop, **pumpkin**. Do this by creating a variable called **pumpkin** and then set its value
as a formula that is the difference between the variables **berries** and **apple**. Add the new variable **pumpkin** to the variable **cost**. Then run the 
code and press the correct button. 

## Step 3 
Look at the last tv monitor, the value of the crops **apple** and **melon** have now changed. **Apple** has increased in price by **2**, 
and **melon** has decreased in price by **3**. Account for this change in your code by using **+=** and **-=** operators.

```template
apple = 10
melon = 15
berries = 20
potato = 2
//Replace the lines below with your code #
//replace with pumpkin variable | Step 2
//apple change                          | Step 3
//melon change                          | Step 3
//cost variable        | Step 1
player.say(cost)
```
