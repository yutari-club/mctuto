**5** `||blocks: place block at position||` commands ,with either **PUMPKIN** or **MELON_BLOCK**, at the correct location variable 
to match the crop at the coordinate. To see the coordinates and coding window at same time, click on the half coding window button in the top left-hand corner.

blocks.place(**crop type**, **location variable**)


```template
location1 = world(-24, 40, -18)
location2 = world(-31, 40, -11)
location3 = world(-28, 40, -16)
location4 = world(-25, 40, -13)
location5 = world(-31, 40, -17)
//Replace the lines below with your code #

//place block at location1 command
//place block at location2 command
//place block at location3 command
//place block at location4 command
//place block at location5 command
