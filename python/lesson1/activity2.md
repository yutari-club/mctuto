# Activity 2 - Whats missing?

```python
player.say()
```

## Step 1
Find out what syntax is missing from the codes on the tv monitors, then place the matching syntax blocks, from the chest, on the gold.
Check the command syntax by using the `||player: say||` command from the `||player:player||` group on the left side of the coding window.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
If you want to remove the syntax blocks, use the **try again** button by talking to the developer.
