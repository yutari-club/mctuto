# Activity 2 - Spin cycle.

```python
for i in range(2):
pass
agent.collect_all()
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
agent.drop_all(FORWARD)
agent.turn(LEFT)

```

## Step 1
**Part 1:** Write some code so that the Agent will pick up the dirty laundry, move **forward** into the machine, spin left **20** times and then get out of
the machine to place the clean laundry on the other side of where the dirty laundry was.

## Step 2
**Part 2:** Edit the same code so that the Agent does the same thing but for **3** loads of laundry. Do this by using a `||loops: for||` loop before all of the other 
code.

### ~ tutorialhint 
Don't forget that, in this case, two loops should not have the same variable name, so rename the second loop.

//loop number 1                              | Part 1

//make the Agent move back                   | Part 1
//make the Agent drop everything to the left | Part 1
//end of loop 2
