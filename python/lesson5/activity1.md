```python
for i in range(2):
pass
agent.collect_all()
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
agent.place(FORWARD)
```

## Step 1
**Part 1:** Write some code so that the Agent will pick up the box and move **6** blocks **forward** and then place it **forward**.

## Step 2
**Part 2:** Edit the same code so that the Agent goes back to the starting point. It needs to do the same thing but **4** times. Use a `||loops: for||` loop at the beginning. 
The boxes will be automatically stacked. 
### ~ tutorialhint 
Don't forget to indent everything after the loop using the **tab** key on the keyboard.
