# Activity 1 - Place the correct block.

```python
blocks.place(GRASS_BLOCK, pos(0, 0, 0))
```

## Step 1
Place the **grass** and **brick** blocks in the designated areas by using the `||blocks: place block at position||` command. Change the first parameter to the required block type 
using the code completion tool to select the required block by starting to type its name and selecting the correct option.

If a block is placed incorrectly use the try again button, to clear and restart the activity, by talking to the NPC.
