```python
blocks.place(GRASS_BLOCK, pos(0, 0, 0))
```

## Step 1
Write some code to construct a line of floor made out of five **plank oak** blocks to get over to the other side. You will need to change the **first** and **second** coordinate of the **second**
parameter in the `||blocks: place block at position||` commands. You must make sure that you build at floor height.
### ~ tutorialhint 
Try using negative numbers as the coordinates.
