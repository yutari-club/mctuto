# What's that syntax!? 

```python
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
pos(0, 0, 0)
player.say("Finished")
agent.place(LEFT)
agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, DOWN) 
agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
agent.destroy(BACK)
agent.drop_all(FORWARD)
agent.collect_all()
loops.pause(500)
for i in range(10):
    pass
if True: 
    pass
else: 
    pass
elif:
    pass
while True:
    pass
```

## Step 1
The code below is missing all of its syntax, add the correct syntax in the coding window to make the code run. 
Then place the matching missing syntax blocks in the world.
```python
for i in range 10
    agent move FORWARD 1
player say  Finished
```
